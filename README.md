# BookApp
- #BookApp is a library in which different categories each category contains its own books and members interact on all those books By commenting or adding to the list of favorite books.
  
- The #application is divided into three mode :
1) Admin: The admin can add or remove a category as well as add or modify or remove the books of each category as well as the admin can interact on any book as if it were a user

2) User: The user can interact with each book by reading, downloading, adding to the list of favorite books or commenting on the book (and has the possibility of removing its comment)

3) Viewer: The viewer is the one who can continue without signing in and he can see what's inside the categories and also read books, but he can't interact with them because he doesn't have a recording.
